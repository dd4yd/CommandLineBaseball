We wanted to create a simple, yet still submersive command line baseball game. The data structure/ requirements we decided to implemented were a circular linked list (2 for each of the two teams), a hash table for when the user wants to search for certain players while drafting a team, and a heapsort, so the user can sort players by a certain statistic while drafting. The user will draft 9 players, back and forth with the computer that they'll play against during the actual game. After the fields are populated and the draft is complete, the playGame function will be called, which obviously is the main loop for the entire game. The game will consist of 9 innings, or 18 half innings. Each player is given a power, contact, and pitching rating, which you'll notice while drafting. the algorithm that determines a strike/ball or a hit/groundout/flyout is comprised of the computer's pitcher rating and the users contact rating. Moreover, the power rating determines the probability of hitting a single, double, triple, or homerun. 

During the draft, pick players based off of their integer ID's (0-39), and if a player has been selected by the computer, you will be prompted to select someone else.
